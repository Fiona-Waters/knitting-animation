 Brief description of the animation achieved:
 
 Simulation of knitting. This inludes 2 moving needles and 2 rows of stitches to begin with. There is a ball of yarn in the bottom 
 left corner attached to the knitting by a strand. As you click the mouse the knitting will grow i.e. a new row will appear. At the 
 same time the yarn ball will decrease in size. Text will also appear asking you to knit 'just one more row' - if you entered your name
 in the dialog box at the beginning this will be added here. This changes when the knitting is completed (after 20 rows/clicks of the mouse).
 When 20 rows have been added the yarn ball will be depleted and the needles will stop. 
 When the mouse is moved pg1 of a knitting pattern will appear in the top right corner of the screen, 
 when the mouse is dragged pg2 of the pattern will appear.
 
 Known bugs/problems: 
 None
